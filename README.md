# SwiftUI Flow Layout

Introduces `HFlow` and `VFlow` similar to `HStack` and `VStack`. 
Takes alignment and padding parameters, arranges views in lines and cuts new lines accordingly (if elements don't fit).

HFlow starts from the leading edge, VStack starts from the top. 
Both flow layouts conform the new Layout protocol in SwiftUI.
